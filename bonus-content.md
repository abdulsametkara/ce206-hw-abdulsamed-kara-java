**Modern Development Practices and Bonus Points**

To encourage adoption of industry-standard tools and practices, bonus points will be awarded for implementing the following advanced features:

**1. Database Integration with Docker (Bonus)**

- **Database Implementation:** Use a containerized database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) with Docker for data storage instead of binary files.

- Set up proper database schema with tables, relationships, and constraints

- Implement data access layer with JDBC or JPA/Hibernate

- Use connection pooling for efficient database connections

- **Docker Configuration:**

- Create Dockerfile for your Java application

- Set up docker-compose.yml to orchestrate your application and database services

- Ensure proper volume configuration for database persistence

- Implement environment variables for configuration management

**2. Authentication and Authorization (Bonus)**

- **Keycloak Integration:** Implement user authentication and authorization using Keycloak
- Set up Keycloak in your Docker Compose environment
- Configure realms, clients, and roles
- Implement login/register functionality in your application
- Manage user sessions and tokens
- Implement role-based access control

**3. System Monitoring and Logging (Bonus)**

- **Monitoring Stack:**

- Implement Prometheus for metrics collection

- Set up Grafana for metrics visualization and dashboards

- Configure Loki for centralized log management

- Create custom dashboards to monitor application performance and health

- **Logging Implementation:**

- Use modern logging framework (e.g., SLF4J with Logback or Log4j2)

- Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels

- Configure log rotation and retention policies

- Ensure logs are accessible through the monitoring system

**4. Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot (Bonus)**

- **Spring Boot REST API:**

- Develop a RESTful API using Spring Boot

- Implement proper API versioning and documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

- Use Spring Data for database operations

- Implement appropriate exception handling and response formats

- **Service Communication:**

- Create a client (console or GUI) that communicates with the REST API

- Implement service discovery or direct communication

- Handle API responses and errors gracefully

- Ensure proper separation between frontend and backend

- **Dockerization of Microservices:**

- Create separate Dockerfiles for each service

- Configure Docker Compose to manage all services

- Implement proper networking between containers

- Ensure proper startup sequence with health checks
